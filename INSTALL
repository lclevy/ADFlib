General information
--------------------
There are 2 buildsystems that can be used - CMake and autotools (links below).
Obviously, a requirement for building is installation of the chosen one.

Testing require also the Check testing framework for C (link below).

Building deb packages require typical tools for that (ie. helper script uses
debuild from devscripts).


Building with CMake
--------------------
There are helper scripts in the util/ directory, which should help doing quick
builds. For instance, to build a release version (both static and binary lib.):
1. $ util/cmake_release_configure
2. $ util/cmake_release_build

Debug version (with gdb and address sanitizer, where available...) can be built
in the same way, just replace "release" with "debug" in the commands above.

To clean the build subdirectory use:
   $ util/cmake_clean

(all have to be configured again for building).

Native device type (generic(dummy) vs. real physical linux/win32 devices) can
be selected by setting ADFLIB_ENABLE_NATIVE_DEV option (to ON or OFF).
For instance:
   $ util/cmake_shared_configure -DADFLIB_ENABLE_NATIVE_DEV:BOOL=ON
would configure build with shared library and support for the real, physical
devices.
Currently, by default only cmake_debug_configure enables real, native devices.

At this stage, if you are not testing (caution, real, physical storage/disk
devices in use!) - use the default: generic (a safe dummy device).

Other options allow to build with or without tests:

ADFLIB_ENABLE_TESTS, ADFLIB_ENABLE_UNIT_TESTS

and build with or without the address sanitizer (normally used only for
debugging/sanitizing memory problems): ADFLIB_ENABLE_ADDRESS_SANITIZER


Building with Autotools
------------------------
Standard way:
1. $ ./autogen.sh
2. $ ./configure
   or better (see the warning below):
   $ ./configure --enable-native-generic
3. $ make

Native devices can be selected with configure script switches:
  --enable-native-generic  Enable generic native devices
  --enable-native-linux    Enable Linux native devices
  --enable-native-win32    Enable Win32 native devices

WARNING: the native device type selected by default by autotools is the one
         NATIVE FOR THE HOST OS(!), so using physical storage (disk)
	 devices(!). At this stage, if you are not testing this functionality
	 in a safe environment (like a VM), it is strongly advised to build
	 only a generic/dummy native device.


Building with Visual Studio
----------------------------
Existing CMake configuration should allow to build with VS. Just open
the directory with the project (or possibly clone the repo with VS).
It should configure automatically, and it can be build as usual ("Build all").

There are 2 debug and 2 release configurations for VS, allowing to build
a static or a shared (DLL) library. All use MSVC compiler (but this can be
changed easily in CMake settings, eg. to clang ).


Building Debian packages
-------------------------
To build a .deb package for Debian (or any derivative), use the helper script:
  $ util/deb_build.sh

In the parent(!) directory (to that of the project), it will create:
- a source package (.tar.gz)
- binary packages (.deb)

The source package alone can be created with:
  $ util/deb_create_quilt3_archive.sh


Testing
--------
There are 3 sets of tests:
- regtests/ - contain regression and some functional tests (with test data,
  like adf images)
- tests/ - mainly unit tests; require Check testing framework (link below)
- examples/tests/ - contains some basic tests of the command-line tools

Note that:
- on Windows (Visual Studio, CygWin) tests with shared library will fail,
  unless the built library (src/adf.dll, cygadf.dll for CygWin) is copied
  to the directories with test binaries (it probably can be fixed and done
  automatically but no time for it now; if sb has good solution for this,
  help welcomed).


Testing with CMake
-------------------
After successful building (see above), automatic tests can be started with:
  $ util/cmake_debug_test   (to test debug version)
  $ util/cmake_shared_test  (for the shared library version)
  $ util/cmake_static_test  (for the static library version)


Testing with Autotools
-----------------------
After successful building (see above), automatic tests can be started with:
  $ make check


Testing with Visual Studio
---------------------------
"Run CTests".

Note that:
- tests using shell scripts does not work - they require sh / bash
  (can be installed and configured but not a standard thing on Windows...)


Installation
-------------
... was not much used / tested. Except for deb packages (which build and
install fine on current Debian stable and on Ubuntu in GitHub Actions).

Basic checks are done by the CI system for CMake and autotools on Linux
(Ubuntu), so those should work fine.

No installation tests on other systems so far...


Installation with CMake
------------------------
(Note that this was not much used / tested!)

To default location:
 $ util/cmake_release_install

To a custom location:
  $ util/cmake_release_install [custom_prefix]

To install one version of the library (static or shared):
 $ util/cmake_shared_install
 $ util/cmake_static_install


Installation with autotools
----------------------------

To a configured location:
  $ make install

To change default location, do:
  $ ./configure --help

and look for prefix options.


Installation with Visual Studio
--------------------------------

Find produced DLL and EXE and copy wherever you want...
(btw. not sure what CMake install does on Windows...)


Cross-compilation (an example)
-------------------------------

Building for Windows can be done cross-compiling eg. on Linux with MinGW:

  $ CC=i686-w64-mingw32-gcc util/cmake_shared_configure

or just use:

  $ util/cmake_shared_configure_cross_mingw

and then normally:

  $ util/cmake_shared_build

Note that the tests will not work for rather obvious reasons - .EXE and .DLL
are not for Linux...
Most likely, it is possible to run the tests eg. using some Windows emulation
like Wine. The executables should work of course, but the testing suites will
require eg. configuring Windows CMake or tinkering test configuration to use
Wine for execution etc...
It should rather be tested and used on the native target system.
