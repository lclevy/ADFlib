ADFlib 0.9.0
- license
  - since this version, the library is on dual license: GPL2 and LGPL 2.1
- api - many changes(!):
  - renamed many functions, constants etc., with the goal
    to provide a separated library namespace
- write support
  - added checking validity of bitmap allocation
  - added possibility to rebuild the bitmap
- command-line utilities:
  - added adf_bitmap - to view or enforce reconstruction of the block
                       allocation bitmap
  - added adf_salvage - to list and recover deleted files
- devices:
  - cleaned-up and unified device interface for all existing device types
    (dump, native), allowing to easily implement and use new types of devices
    in a safe and controlled way (enabling/disabling types of devices in code)
  - added ramdisk device (to allow eg. faster testing)
- numerous refactorings, improvements and bugfixes, among them:
  - segfault on reading bitmap (rootblock bmpages beyond expected size)
    - several memory leaks (mosly in uncommon cases) and many other
      memory-related issues (thanks to Didier Malenfant!)
  - improved and better tested block allocation bitmap code
- tests
  - many added and/or improved

ADFlib 0.8.0
- files:
  - complete and tested read/write support (#30)
- directories:
  - added a function for counting entries
- links (#23):
  - hardlinks: added support (can open a file or enter a dir using a hardlink)
  - softlinks: added basic support (can get path where it points to)
- devices:
  - added functions to open/close a device without mounting (eg. for formatting)
- native devices:
  - getting geometry directly from the device (if possible)
  - added support for Linux native devices (experimental, assume testing only
    and use with care!)
- command-line utilities:
  - added adf_floppy_create/format - create and format devices/images
  - added adf_show_metadata - show device/volume/file/directory metadata
  - unadf: added option -w enabling replacement of forbidden characters and
    filenames on Windows (#39)
- numerous bugfixes, among them
  - some memory leaks (adfFreeGenBlock, tests, ...)
  - a buffer overflow (in adfGetDelEnt())
  - fixed Debian bug 862740 (buffer overflow in adfGetCacheEntry; #35)
  - problems when filling up the disk (#9)
- testing - improved and extended:
  - added more reg. tests, some improvements and bugfixes in existing ones
  - added unit tests (using Check framework)
  - automatic building and testing with GitHub Actions
- code quality:
  - some refactoring and tidying up
- build configuration:
  - added configuration for CMake (besides existing autotools), so that the lib
    can be more portable and build easier eg. with Visual Studio on Windows
- packaging:
  - added basic Debian support (works also on Ubuntu, should work on other
    systems with deb packages)
- many changes in the API (note the version change!):
  - mainly in adf_file (new/changed functions, function naming)
  - some changes in data structures and/or data types

- Minor Makefile fixes. Works under Fedora Core 5, gcc 4.1.0.
- Inclusing of Bjarke Viksoe C++ wrapper (adfwrapper.h). Windows specific for the moment, 
  but good example of C++ wrapper on top of ADFlib.

ADFlib 0.7.9c by Bjarke Viksoe 
- changes : Win32/nt4_dev.c
	.return RC_ERROR instead of FALSE
	.return TRUE when input parameter of NT4CloseDrive is NULL
- changes : Win32/defendian.h
	changes printf and putchar into -empty string- for Win32 GUI applications
- fix : in adf_hd.c, in adfMountDev(), dumpfiledevice was assumed sometimes, but it could be native. 
	"if (dev->isNativeDev)" when needed
- fix : in adf_hd.c, in adfMountDev(), some memory release was forgotten in case of error
- change : adf_hd.c, line 36, floppy dump files with 83 sectors are now valid (request by users)
- change : adf_hd.c , adfReadRDSKBlock(), ignore checksum error. Win98 modifies this sector
